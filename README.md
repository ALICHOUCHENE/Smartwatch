Smartwatch circuit for health and fitness
This robust fitness watch was designed for football players who leads an active lifestyle and values health and well-being. 
The watch creates for a personal training plan that adapts to some fitness needs. 
This smart-watch will provide a real-time guidance while exercising to help the player at the right intensity.
24/7 activity tracking with steps, calories and sleep, together with stress and recovery monitoring, provide a real time heart rate monitoring and help to maintain a healthy balance between activity and rest.

Here the features of the board:

- Xtensa dual-core 32-bit LX6 microprocessor(WROOM-32D) is the CPU of the board. operating at 240 MHz.
- Optical Sensor IC,BH1792GLC, a heart rate monitor module integrated with LED driver, green light, and IR detection photodiode.
- 1Cell / 3.7V 230mA Battery Management System / BMS Over Voltage, Over Current, Short Circuit Protection Module for Lithium ION Batterie.
- UART programming interface.
- USB port for charging.

 #Manufacturing
 
After finishing the Routing and verify the pcb. We made the board at JLC PCB and we chose also the PCB Assembly service.
Here is the BOM needed for jlcpcb assembly service:
